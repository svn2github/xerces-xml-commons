Describes how to build xml-commons distributions and documentation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The xml-commons distribution contains various utilities. Each utility
is also available as a separate distribution (currently only resolver).

* The top-level build.xml controls everything. It calls the separate
build files for each sub-project. The sub-project builds can also be
called direectly

* All documentation is built by Apache Forrest (so you need that locally
installed). See http://xml.apache.org/commons/howto-forrest.html
The website update cronjob happens via user dims at 01:00 and 13:00 GMT.

... Builds separate resolver distribution and copies over some relevant
Forrest-built docs.

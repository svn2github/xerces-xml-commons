      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        This is the procedure for building the xml-commons website
        with Apache Forrest.

      <p>which validates and builds the docs.
        If you want to only validate the xdocs then do
        <code>'forrest validate-xdocs'</code>. You can get even faster
        turnaround for developing the docs by using <code>'forrest run'</code>
        to run a live forrest webapp. When finished, do 
        <code>'forrest'</code> to build the full site.

    <section id="xml-site">
      <title>Updating the website</title>
      <p>Copy everything in <code>./build/site</code> over to the xml-site
        repository at <code>xml-site/targets/commons</code> and commit.
      </p>
      <p>There is a cronjob on www.apache.org that does a regular cvs checkout
        to refresh the website.
      </p>

    <section id="other">
      <title>Other notes</title>
<p>
There are some other general notes at <code>xml-commons/readme-build.txt</code>
</p>

<p>
A project sitemap has been added at
<code>src/documentation/sitemap.xmap</code>
There is a hard-coded path in our sitemap to the DocBook XSL stylesheets.
If that is different on your system, then tweak the sitemap.xmap to suit.
</p>

<p>Try to keep our skinconf.xml and forrest.properties
in sync with the Forrest "fresh-site" stuff.

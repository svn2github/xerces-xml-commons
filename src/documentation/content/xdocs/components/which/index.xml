        Which is a simple environment checking utility that focuses on reporting the versions of 
        various XML interfaces and some common Apache projects.

      <p>Currently, most of the documentation about Which is in it's Javadoc, which you can 
      build via <code>build docs</code>.</p>
      <fixme author="curcuru">Still need to write overview and user guide docs, as well
